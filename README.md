# RedBall-Hero
Redball Hero is a web-based game where players control a small red ball and navigate through challenging levels filled with obstacles and enemies. This project was developed as part of a college assignment, 
using C++ programming language and SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for the graphics library. 
The game incorporates three design patterns: State, Factory, and Multimethod, to enhance code structure and maintainability.

## Features

- Intuitive controls: Players can move the red ball using the arrow keys or WASD.
- Level-based gameplay: The game consists of multiple levels, each with increasing difficulty and unique obstacles.
- Collectibles: Players can collect stars scattered throughout the levels to earn points.
- Obstacles and enemies: Levels are filled with various obstacles and enemies that players must avoid to progress.
- State pattern: The State design pattern is used to manage different states of the game, such as menu, gameplay, and game over.
- Factory pattern: The Factory design pattern is utilized to create game objects, such as platforms and enemies, dynamically.
- Multimethod pattern: The Multimethod design pattern is employed to handle collisions between different game objects efficiently.

## Prerequisites

To run the Redball Hero web game, you need to have the following software installed:

- C++ compiler (compatible with C++11 or later)
- SFML library (version 2.5.1 or later)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Make sure you have SFML installed on your system. If not, you can download it from the [SFML website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) and follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.
3. Open the project in your preferred C++ development environment.
4. Build the project using the C++ compiler, linking against the SFML library.
5. Run the executable file generated after compilation.

## Usage

- Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the red ball.
- Navigate through the levels, avoiding obstacles and enemies.
- Collect stars to earn points and advance to the next level.
- Reach the end of each level to complete the game.
