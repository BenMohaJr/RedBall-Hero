Redball Hero is a web-based game where players control a small red ball and navigate through challenging levels filled with obstacles and enemies. This project was developed as part of a college assignment, using C++ programming language and SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for the graphics library. The game incorporates three design patterns: State, Factory, and Multimethod, to enhance code structure and maintainability. Additionally, the game utilizes Box2D as the physics library for realistic object interactions and movement.

## Features

- Intuitive controls: Players can move the red ball using the arrow keys.
- Level-based gameplay: The game consists of multiple levels, each with increasing difficulty and unique obstacles.
- Collectibles: Players can collect stars scattered throughout the levels to earn points.
- Obstacles and enemies: Levels are filled with various obstacles and enemies that players must avoid to progress.
- Physics simulation: Box2D physics library is used to provide realistic object interactions, including gravity, collisions, and movement.
- State pattern: The State design pattern is used to manage different states of the game, such as menu, gameplay, and game over.
- Factory pattern: The Factory design pattern is utilized to create game objects, such as platforms and enemies, dynamically.
- Multimethod pattern: The Multimethod design pattern is employed to handle collisions between different game objects efficiently.

## Prerequisites

To run the Redball Hero web game, you need to have the following software and libraries installed:

- C++ compiler (compatible with C++11 or later)
- SFML library (version 2.5.1 or later)
- Box2D physics library (version 2.4.1 or later)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Make sure you have SFML and Box2D installed on your system. If not, you can download them from their respective websites ([SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php), [Box2D](https://box2d.org/downloads/)), and follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.
3. Open the project in your preferred C++ development environment.
4. Build the project using the C++ compiler, linking against the SFML and Box2D libraries.
5. Run the executable file generated after compilation.

## Usage

- Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the red ball.
- Navigate through the levels, avoiding obstacles and enemies.
- Collect stars to earn points and advance to the next level.
- Experience realistic physics interactions and movement powered by the Box2D library.
- Reach the end of each level to complete the game.
